They hire experienced guys from reputed organisations and force them to resign after 1 year . Same scenario was being followed in WSB division was there from last many years before my joining . Old senior persons ( National Head &specific Regional Manager) always discourage new employees in system  and create undue pressure without having or telling any strategy to develop the market . Higher Management in WSB division never allow to grow new employees and give them credit for their good work. There is a lot of politics in WSB division .Old employees ( less qualified ) are saving their jobs by removing high qualified experienced new employees each year. Management in WSB Division ( National Head & specific RM )  does not have any strategy to develop the dead  territories and encouraging the employees. RM take credit of all hard and good work done by new employees and show them as non performer.
They took advantage of Covid 19 situation and removed newly hired employees ( experienced employees from reputed organisations ) within 1 year .It was terrible working in WSB division.
Fans ,appliances and other divisions are comparatively very good and professional.
Only thing good that salary and incentives are released on time....Read More","Everything About Water Solutions Business Division . National Head and RM does not have any strategy to develop the dead territories.They take credit of all hard work done by newly hired employees ( experienced employees from reputed organisations ),business of developed territories and show them in their name only .Further all failures of dead territories they show in the name of  new employees only and save their jobs by showing cost cutting and removing the newly hired experienced employees within 1 year. Working in Water Solutions Business Division of Usha International was the worst experience in my whole career . I sold 3 times nos. more Dispensers from previous year by appointing new distributors but RM took credit all of that sale in his name without doing anything and gave me no credit for that. Out of 10 new dealers/distributors appointed in FY 2019 - 20, I appointed 8 with my efforts only without any support  but RM gave no credit & showed all sale in his success stories only. RM always tried to discourage & humilate most of the times just to show off in front of other office staff members and also in front of distributors. RM used to talk distributors ( appointed & dealt by me) to make negative image of mine so that he can get enquiries  directly & show that sale in his name while it was only me who appointed new distributors & liquidated  jammed stock of old dealers without any support .But when they started to give regular sales, RM made my  image negative to them and by using his designation power he said them to contact him directly.
VERY VERY UNPROFESSIONAL behaviour by RM  & NSM which I never saw in my whole career in any of the organizations I worked. RM took all my orders, distributors & in the last my job too. In lock down APR 2020 to Aug 2020 more than 75% sale of total was done by dealers/ distributors appointed or handled by me only but RM showed all that as his success only.
Never join this organization in Water Solutions Business Division....Read More"

They hire experienced guys from reputed organisations and force them to resign after 1 year . Same scenario was being followed in WSB division was there from last many years before my joining . Old senior persons ( National Head &specific Regional Manager) always discourage new employees in system  and create undue pressure without having or telling any strategy to develop the market . Higher Management in WSB division never allow to grow new employees and give them credit for their good work. There is a lot of politics in WSB division .Old employees ( less qualified ) are saving their jobs by removing high qualified experienced new employees each year. Management in WSB Division ( National Head & specific RM )  does not have any strategy to develop the dead  territories and encouraging the employees. RM take credit of all hard and good work done by new employees and show them as non performer.
They took advantage of Covid 19 situation and removed newly hired employees ( experienced employees from reputed organisations ) within 1 year .It was terrible working in WSB division.
Fans ,appliances and other divisions are comparatively very good and professional.
Only thing good that salary and incentives are released on time....Read More","Everything About Water Solutions Business Division . National Head and RM does not have any strategy to develop the dead territories.They take credit of all hard work done by newly hired employees ( experienced employees from reputed organisations ),business of developed territories and show them in their name only .Further all failures of dead territories they show in the name of  new employees only and save their jobs by showing cost cutting and removing the newly hired experienced employees within 1 year. Working in Water Solutions Business Division of Usha International was the worst experience in my whole career . I sold 3 times nos. more Dispensers from previous year by appointing new distributors but RM took credit all of that sale in his name without doing anything and gave me no credit for that. Out of 10 new dealers/distributors appointed in FY 2019 - 20, I appointed 8 with my efforts only without any support  but RM gave no credit & showed all sale in his success stories only. RM always tried to discourage & humilate most of the times just to show off in front of other office staff members and also in front of distributors. RM used to talk distributors ( appointed & dealt by me) to make negative image of mine so that he can get enquiries  directly & show that sale in his name while it was only me who appointed new distributors & liquidated  jammed stock of old dealers without any support .But when they started to give regular sales, RM made my  image negative to them and by using his designation power he said them to contact him directly.
VERY VERY UNPROFESSIONAL behaviour by RM  & NSM which I never saw in my whole career in any of the organizations I worked. RM took all my orders, distributors & in the last my job too. In lock down APR 2020 to Aug 2020 more than 75% sale of total was done by dealers/ distributors appointed or handled by me only but RM showed all that as his success only.
Never join this organization in Water Solutions Business Division....Read More"
