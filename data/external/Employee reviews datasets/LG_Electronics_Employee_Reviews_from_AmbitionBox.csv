Checked every department's culture before putting this thoughtful review.,"General trend and culture in every department where seniors look for a reason to downgrade your ratings to avoid promotions and appraisals so that they can show cost savings to there bosses and get appraisals for them selves. Go ahead and take a feed back yourself with some one who is genuine to you. Old wolves own the company who are old in the system, who are good for nothing with zero decision making powers and business understanding /Sense and  worst communication skills, leaves every decision on Koreans. Koreans are actually working to keep this company running. But ultimately you work in India with Indian team members. Just a small example- even approving your within city travel reimbursement valuing just 300-400 bucks. If you are a new comer expect zero support from seniors, because they feel threatened if you learn their work and if you are smart to learn on your own, you are a bigger threat and seniors will find silly excuses to negatively market you. Love this company as being a market leader they try to do new initiative but company people are in truly sarkari mode of work. Competition is a part of every job, if you don't like competition then you are good for no job but every department is filled a filthy mentality of holding their position by stepping onto your head and get themselves promoted....Read More"
