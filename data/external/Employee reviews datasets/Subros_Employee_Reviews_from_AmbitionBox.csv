Talking about job security, No one will kick you out until and unless you are found for any illegal activities. You do your work or not, no one will kick you out. Work culture is worse. As the managers only sit and enjoy, they only exploit the engineers and take all the credits. Talking about work-life balance, I will rate it on a negative scale. They can call you or make you stay anytime. There will be a time when you will be working 12 to 14 hour a day, and you will be working on Sundays too. I don't know much about its upper management, but the Plant level management is pretty bad. They do no care for anything, any policies. They only want work. You will sometimes feel as if they have just bought you. You will be working as a slave.

Talking about job security, No one will kick you out until and unless you are found for any illegal activities. You do your work or not, no one will kick you out. Work culture is worse. As the managers only sit and enjoy, they only exploit the engineers and take all the credits. Talking about work-life balance, I will rate it on a negative scale. They can call you or make you stay anytime. There will be a time when you will be working 12 to 14 hour a day, and you will be working on Sundays too. I don't know much about its upper management, but the Plant level management is pretty bad. They do no care for anything, any policies. They only want work. You will sometimes feel as if they have just bought you. You will be working as a slave.
Talking about policies. Yes, It has made good policies, but unfortunately, all are on papers only, nothing is implemented....Read More"
